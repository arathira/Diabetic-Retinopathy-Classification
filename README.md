# Diabetic Retinopathy Classification
 
Diabetic  Retinopathy  (DR)  is  an  eye  abnormality  caused  as a  result  of  long  term  diabetes.  As  the  disease progresses it leads to distortion and blurred vision. The diagnosis of DR using color fundus image requires skilled clinicians to identify the presence of critical features which makes this a difficult and time consuming task. This project proposes a CNN based automated  diagnoses of  DR  from  digital  fundus  images.  

## Why need an automated system for DR diagnosis?
• Features of DR at initial stages are minute and hard to detect.
• Ever increasing number of Diabetic patients and less number of experienced
clinicians
• Conventional approach is time consuming, an automated system helps in early
diagnosis.
• Automated system can greatly reduce the clinical burden on retina specialists.
• This also helps to monitor the dynamics of the lesions in a much faster way.
